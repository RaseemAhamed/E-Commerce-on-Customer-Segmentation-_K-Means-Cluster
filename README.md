# E-Commerce-on-Customer-Segmentation-_K-Means-Cluster

### Abstract:
A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the ecommerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

### Problem Statement:
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.

### Dataset Information:
The data was collected from a well known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customer’s search profile.

### Variable Description:
1.Cust_ID - Unique numbering for customers
2.Gender - Gender of the customer
3.Orders - Number of orders placed by each customer in the past

#### Remaining 35 features (brands) contains the number of times customers have searched them

### Scope:
● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights about the purchase pattern

● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment

● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of silhouette score

### Conclusion:
E-commerce Customer Segmentation Dataset is trained by using K-Means Clustering Technique, There are six groups that seperates the independant variables are determined by using Elbow method and the model fit is executed by using Random forest Classifier Technique with an Accuracy of 0.9990835777126099
